            I started my journey into IT and Coding back in 2016 where I attended the University of Cincinnati. <br> While persuing my Bachelors in software development the warehouse where I worked gave me the oppurtunity to start helping with IT projects<br>            From there I went on to get a Job as Help Desk where I would help people troubleshoot PC and software related Issues.
            <br>I later went on to work for Innomark as a onsite IT where issues are more hands on and I currently help with onsite issues and have began assisting with some coding as well.
